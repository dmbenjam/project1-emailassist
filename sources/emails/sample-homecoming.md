Subject: Homecoming Weekend is calling — join us back on campus

Hi [First Name],

There’s nothing like returning to campus and feeling that Syracuse spirit again. Homecoming Weekend brings Orange fans and alumni together for events, traditions, and time with friends old and new.

We’d love to see you there. Take a moment to review the weekend schedule and reserve your spot for the events that fit your plans.
